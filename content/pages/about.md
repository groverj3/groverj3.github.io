Title: Hi!

I work with "big data" (and small, and medium data!) from "next-generation 
sequencing" (will it ever be "current-gen?"). I've analyzed data from small
RNA-sequencing, mRNA-sequencing, and whole-genome bisulfite-sequencing over the
course of my PhD work. If you're looking for someone with my skillset I'm very
interested in hearing from you!

### From "The Mitten"...

I hail from [Edwardsburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwardsburg,_Michigan), a
small town, technically a "village" of 1,226 (2017) people. It's located only 10
minutes' drive from The University of Notre Dame's campus in South Bend, Indiana,
and roughly 2 hours from Chicago.

In high school I made extra cash building and repairing computers. I also learned
a bit of web development at this time, which was my first exposure to
programming. I dabbled in open source software, installing Linux on my parents'
computer and learned the basics of working on a command line and shell scripting.

I attended Michigan State University (Go Green!), where I majored in biochemistry
and molecular biology. There, I worked in
[Dr. Robert Last's](https://bmb.natsci.msu.edu/faculty/robert-l-last/)
lab, where I received training in molecular biology and genetics.

After graduating in 2011 with my B.S. I worked for MPI Research, Inc. in
Mattawan, MI. Just outside of Kalamazoo (a real place). I extracted DNA/RNA,
performed qPCR assays, and ordered supplies for our lab. Due to the nature of
their work and FDA's regulations (the GLPs) I also did a lot of paperwork. After
two years there I decided to move on to graduate school.

### ... to the Southwest

I came to The University of Arizona to complete a professional science masters.
I took classes related to patent law, finance, and economics in addition to
graduate-level molecular biology and biochemistry. For my masters thesis I worked
in
[Dr. Rebecca Mosher's lab](https://cals.arizona.edu/research/mosherlab/Mosher_Lab/Home.html)
and designed a qPCR-based assay for measuring DNA methylation. I also was
introduced to the field of bioinformatics. I completed my masters in 2015 and
decided to remain at Arizona and pursue a Ph.D. and combine my life-long interest
in computing with my previous experience in molecular biology.

During my Ph.D. I've learned a lot and I love sharing what I know. My background
in shell scripting and Python programming has proven useful. I also do a bang-up
job in R and manage the lab's server as the de-facto sysadmin. In addition to my
work, I've mentored undergraduate and high school students in the lab and I feel
I have a knack for motivating people to give their best effort.

As I near the end of my Ph.D. my interests currently lie in improving my
knowledge of applied statistics, and leveraging concepts from data science and
machine learning in my work. I'm a fast learner, whether it's learning a static
website generating framework (Pelican), updating the UI of a web portal for NGS
analysis ([CoGe](https://genomevolution.org/coge/)) in Javascript, or creating a
reproducible analysis pipeline with SnakeMake. The greatest skills I've acquired
in my Ph.D. are the ability to learn quickly and work collaboratively with a
team.

### When I'm Not Working

Aside from biology, data science, and general computer nerdery I have a few
hobbies. I'm an avid guitarist (mostly Jacksons, though my gear acquisition
syndrome is equal opportunity), and I try to see one of my favorite 
prog-rock/metal bands every chance I get. Related to that, I've dabbled in
recording and music production. You can usually find me playing some classic RPGs
as well (Chrono Trigger is a personal favorite). When I'm unwinding with friends
you can find me wherever fine craft beers are sold (no thank you on the IPAs
though)!
