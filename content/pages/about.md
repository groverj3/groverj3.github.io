Title: About Me

I work with "big data" (and small, and medium data!) from "next-generation 
sequencing" (will it ever be "current-gen?").  If you're looking for someone with
my skillset then let's talk!

### From "The Mitten"...

I hail from [Edwardsburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwardsburg,_Michigan), a
small town, technically a "village" of 1,226 (2017) people. It's located only 10
minutes' drive from The University of Notre Dame's campus in South Bend, Indiana,
and roughly 2 hours from Chicago.

In high school I made extra cash building and repairing computers. I also learned
a bit of web development at this time, which was my first exposure to
programming. I dabbled in open source software, installing Linux on my parents'
computer and learned the basics of working on a command line and shell scripting.

I attended Michigan State University (Go Green!), where I majored in biochemistry
and molecular biology. There, I worked in
[Dr. Robert Last's](https://bmb.natsci.msu.edu/faculty/robert-l-last/)
lab, where I received training in molecular biology and genetics.

After graduating in 2011 with my B.S. I worked for MPI Research, Inc. in
Mattawan, MI. Just outside of Kalamazoo (a real place). I extracted DNA/RNA,
performed qPCR assays, and ordered supplies for our lab. Due to the nature of
their work and FDA's regulations (the GLPs) I also did a lot of paperwork. After
two years there I decided to move on to graduate school.

### ... to the Southwest

I came to The University of Arizona to complete a professional science masters.
I took classes related to patent law, finance, and economics in addition to
graduate-level molecular biology and biochemistry. For my masters thesis I worked
in
[Dr. Rebecca Mosher's lab](https://cals.arizona.edu/research/mosherlab/Mosher_Lab/Home.html)
and designed a qPCR-based assay for measuring DNA methylation. I also was
introduced to the field of bioinformatics. I completed my masters in 2015 and
decided to remain at Arizona and pursue a Ph.D. and combine my life-long interest
in computing with my previous experience in molecular biology.

During my Ph.D. I learned a lot and loved sharing that knowledge. My background
in shell scripting and Python programming continues to be useful. I also learned
to do a bang-up job in R and managed the lab's server as the de-facto sysadmin.
In addition, I mentored undergraduate and high school students in the lab, and I
feel I have a knack for motivating people to give their best effort.

At the end of my Ph.D. work, I started getting more interested in bioinformatics
workflow development. This is important to drive the field forward; increasing
our ability to do reproducible research and to work with ever larger datasets. I
implemented a few of the lab's workflows, for whole-genome bisulfite sequencing
and small RNA sequencing as SnakeMake workflows using Docker containers. This
experience directly allowed me to start my career in biotech...

### To Boston and New England!

As we traveled forward through time, roughly at 1s/s (give or take), we ended up
in 2020. We all know what happened in February and March. Just as I began my job
search, suddenly everything shut down. Luckily, I was able, after roughly 200
applications to get a great opporunity at [Seven Bridges](https://www.sevenbridges.com/).

I worked with a lot of great people there, and was able to bring my practical
experience running bioinformatics workflows to a company focused on implementing
them at scale. We developed best practices for developing workflows, and how to
deploy them on the Seven Bridges Platform. I gave presentations to the National
Cancer Institute and was involved in developing R Shiny Apps. I also gained
experience managing large scale NGS projects at the 100 TB scale. I'm proud of
the progress we made in pushing cloud computing for bioinformatics forward.

After roughly two years I decided to move on, and return (somewhat) to my roots.
I accepted a position at Entrada Therapeutics, where I currently am employed.
Here, I am working to build the company's bioinformatics and data science
standards as well as its research computing infrastructure. However, I can also
directly use my experience with workflow, data visualization, and downstream
analysis of NGS data to aid in their mission to develop therapies for rare
diseases. To accomplish this, I'm working to develop biomarkers using NGS
experiments as their first full-time bioinformatics hire.

### When I'm Not Working

Aside from biology, data science, and general computer nerdery I have a few
hobbies. I'm an avid guitarist (mostly Jacksons, though my gear acquisition
syndrome is equal opportunity), and I try to see one of my favorite 
prog-rock/metal bands every chance I get. Related to that, I've dabbled in
recording and music production. You can usually find me playing some classic RPGs
as well (Chrono Trigger is a personal favorite). When I'm unwinding with friends
you can find me wherever fine craft beers are sold (no thank you on the IPAs
though)!
