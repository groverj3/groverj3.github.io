Title: Hi!

## I'm Jeff. A Bioinformatician.

I live at the intersection between big data and biology (and buzzwords), but also
am very interested in applying data science concepts outside the realm of
bioinformatics.

I'm also a Ph.D. candidate in the [Molecular and Cellular Biology Graduate
Program](http://http://bmcb.biology.arizona.edu/) at [The University of Arizona](https://www.arizona.edu/).

I work here in the [Mosher Lab](https://cals.arizona.edu/research/mosherlab/Mosher_Lab/Home.html)
studying RNA-directed DNA methylation through next-generation sequencing
techniques. 

Welcome to my little corner of the internet! This is a work-in-progress, but for
now you can view this page, a page [about me](/pages/about.html), and a [blog post](/pages/blog.html)
or two.
