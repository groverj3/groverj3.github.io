Title: I'm Jeff. A Bioinformatician.

I live at the intersection between big data and biology (and buzzwords), and am
very interested in applying data science concepts outside of bioinformatics.

I code in **Python**, **R**, **BASH**, and anything else that piques my interest.

I can manage a multi-user **Linux** server environment and I'm comfortable on the
command line.

I believe in **open** science, **open** source software, **reproducible** data
analysis

I've analyzed small RNA, mRNA, and whole-genome bisulfite sequencing. I've
updated transcriptomes, annotated small RNA loci, and compared methylomes.

I can create an analysis pipeline and interface it with high performance
computing resources, or create visualizations and explore data in a jupyter
notebook.

I'm also a Ph.D. candidate in the
[Molecular and Cellular Biology Graduate Program](http://http://bmcb.biology.arizona.edu/)
at [The University of Arizona](https://www.arizona.edu/). I work here in the
[Mosher Lab](https://cals.arizona.edu/research/mosherlab/Mosher_Lab/Home.html)
studying RNA-directed DNA methylation through next-generation sequencing
techniques. 

While you're here you can learn something [about me](/pages/about.html) or check
out my [blog](/pages/blog.html) where I post how-tos, thoughts on bioinformatics,
and general nonsense.
