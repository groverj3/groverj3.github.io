Title: I'm Jeff. A Bioinformatician.

I live at the intersection between big data and biology (and buzzwords), but also
am very interested in applying data science concepts outside the realm of
bioinformatics.

I'm also a Ph.D. candidate in the
[Molecular and Cellular Biology Graduate Program](http://http://bmcb.biology.arizona.edu/)
at [The University of Arizona](https://www.arizona.edu/).

I work here in the
[Mosher Lab](https://cals.arizona.edu/research/mosherlab/Mosher_Lab/Home.html)
studying RNA-directed DNA methylation through next-generation sequencing
techniques. 

While you're here you can learn something [about me](/pages/about.html) or check
out my [blog](/pages/blog.html) where I post how-tos, thoughts on bioinformatics,
and general nonsense.
