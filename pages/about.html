  </header>
  <div>
<p>I work with "big data" (and small, and medium data!) from "next-generation 
sequencing" (will it ever be "current-gen?"). I've analyzed data from small
RNA-sequencing, mRNA-sequencing, and whole-genome bisulfite-sequencing over the
course of my PhD work. I'm excited to soon be transitioning to a career following
the completion of my doctoral studies in the Spring-Summer of 2020.</p>
<p>If you're looking for someone with my skillset I'm very interested in hearing
from you!</p>
<h3>Getting Here Wasn't Straightforward</h3>
<p>I grew up in a small town in southwest Michigan, called Niles. Though, it'd be
more appropriate to say that I grew up in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwardsburg,_Michigan">Edwardsburg</a>, an even more
obscure one, technically a "village" of 1,226 (2017) people. Small, but by no
means isolated. It's located only 10 minutes' drive from The University of Notre
Dame's campus in South Bend, Indiana, and roughly 2 hours drive from Chicago.</p>
<p>Growing up, I was always interested in technology. I made extra cash building and
repairing computers in high school. I also learned a bit of web development at
this time, which was my first exposure to programming. I dabbled in open source
software installing Linux on my parents computer and learned the basics of
working on a command line and shell scripting.</p>

<p>I was also interested in biology and chemistry, and therefore decided to double
major in biochemistry &amp; molecular biology and chemistry at Michigan State
University (Go Green!), where I received my B.S. in 2011. I had the opportunity
to work in
<a href="https://bmb.natsci.msu.edu/faculty/robert-l-last/">Dr. Robert Last's</a> lab,
identifying genes which affect lipid production using the model plant
<em>Arabidopsis thaliana</em>. With application to engineering crops for biofuel
production.</p>
<p>Following undergrad I got a job working for MPI Research, Inc. in Mattawan, MI.
Just outside of Kalamazoo (a real place, believe it or not). This was my first
exposure to science outside of academia. There I mostly extracted DNA, performed
qPCR assays, and ordered supplies for our lab. Due to the nature of their work
and the FDA's regulated (the GLPs) we also did a lot of paperwork. After two
years there I had decided to move on to graduate school.</p>
<p>I came to The University of Arizona to complete a professional science masters.
This was a new degree that fit with my experience and my goals of continuing to
work in the biotech industry. I took classes related to patent law, finance, and
economics in addition to graduate-level molecular biology and biochemistry. For
my masters thesis I worked in
<a href="https://cals.arizona.edu/research/mosherlab/Mosher_Lab/Home.html">Dr. Rebecca Mosher's lab</a>
and designed a qPCR-based assay for measuring DNA methylation. I also was
introduced to the field of bioinformatics. I completed my masters in 2015 and
decided to remain at Arizona and pursue a Ph.D. in order to combine my interests
in computing with my previous experience in molecular biology.</p>
<h3>Turning a Hobby Into a Profession</h3>
<p><center>

</center></p>
<p>Since beginning my Ph.D. in 2015 I've learned a lot. My background in shell
scripting and Python programming has proven useful. I've also picked up R
programming. In my opinion, these are the most vital skills that a
bioinformatician needs to have to be productive on a day-to-day basis. I also
manage the lab's server, installing software, setting up new users, and solving
any hardware and software issues. In addition to my work, I've also mentored
undergraduate and high school students in the lab and I feel I have a knack for
motivating people to give their best effort.</p>
<p>As I near the end of my Ph.D. my interests currently lie in improving my
knowledge of applied statistics, and leveraging concepts from data science and
machine learning in my work. I'm a fast learner, whether it's learning a static
website generating framework (Pelican), updating the UI of a web portal for NGS
analysis (<a href="https://genomevolution.org/coge/">CoGe</a>) in Javascript, or creating a
reproducible analysis pipeline with SnakeMake. The greatest skills I've acquired
in my Ph.D. are the ability to learn quickly and work collaboratively with a
team.</p>
<h3>When I'm Not Working</h3>
<p><center>

</center></p>
<p>Aside from biology, data science, and general computer nerdery I have a few
hobbies. I'm an avid guitarist (mostly Jacksons, though my gear acquisition
syndrome is equal opportunity), and I try to see Dream Theater or another one of
my favorite prog-rock/metal bands every chance I get. Related to that, I've
dabbled in recording and music production. You can usually find me playing some
classic RPGs as well (Chrono Trigger is a personal favorite). When I'm unwinding
with friends you can find me wherever fine craft beers are sold (no thank you on
the IPAs though)!</p>  </div>
