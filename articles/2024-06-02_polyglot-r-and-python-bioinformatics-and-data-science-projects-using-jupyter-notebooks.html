    <p>TLDR - Check out this github repo for a (still really wordy) example:
<a href="https://github.com/groverj3/polyglot_jupyter_example">polyglot_jupyter_example</a></p>
<p>If you're anything like me, and there are probably tens of you out there, you
enjoy working in multiple programming languages for your bioinformatics/data
science work. Perhaps you love the <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/">tidyverse</a> R
ecosystem for data manipulation but prefer packages from a Python library like
<a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html">Scikit-learn</a>. Or, as is becoming
increasingly common, you're working on single-cell RNAseq analysis and you like
normalization provided by <a href="https://satijalab.org/seurat/">Seurat</a>, need to
load data types only supported in the Python <a href="https://github.com/scverse">scverse</a>,
and want to use the Bioconductor <a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/SingleCellExperiment.html">SingleCellExperiment</a>
class to store your data.</p>
<p>If you're tried to use both Python and R in the same project maybe you've
already realized that <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter notebooks and lab</a> support
many kernel types, including R. By installing the <a href="https://irkernel.github.io/">R Kernel</a>
in addition to the default <a href="https://github.com/ipython/ipykernel">ipython kernel</a>
you can use Jupyter for both R and Python notebooks, harmonizing your workflow
across both languages. However, there is another consideration, having a
reproducible <em>environment</em>.</p>
<h2>Enter virtualenv and renv</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv"><img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16530698?s=200&v=4" alt="Pyenv" style="width:120px;height:120px;"></a>
<a href="https://github.com/rstudio/renv"><img src="https://rstudio.github.io/renv/logo.svg" alt="Renv" style="width:120px;height:120px;"></a></p>
<p>Python virtual environments have been around for a very long time. They're a
great way to make sure that your package versions for a given project are
recorded, frozen, and don't conflict with those packages you're installed for
other projects. The standard library module <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html">venv</a>
and the installable package <a href="https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/">virtualenv</a>
allow you to manage them. I typically use <a href="https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv">pyenv</a>
to install and manage python versions, and it has an extension for managing
virtual environments as well: <a href="https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv">pyenv-virtualenv</a>.
Confusingly, pyenv-virtualenv actually uses <code>venv</code> (mostly).</p>
<p>On the R side of things, it seems virtual environments or project environments,
haven't had as much focus. Generally, packages are very backwards compatible in
R land. However, the package <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/renv/index.html">renv</a>
is getting more attention. I think it's great for the R community. It's long
been commonplace to run <code>sessionInfo()</code> at the end of a notebook or script to
make sure you know which packages are in-use and their versions. Instead,
<code>renv</code> allows creating a project-specific library and tracks versions of all
packages used (though, you should still run <code>sessionInfo()</code> for in your
notebooks for completeness, I think).</p>
<p>There are lots of guides for Python virtual environments, but fewer at this
time for <code>renv</code>. It's pretty easy to start using though, just install it with
<code>install.packages("renv")</code>, restart R, initialize it in a directory for your project
<code>renv::init()</code>, install the packages you want, then update the lockfile with
<code>renv::snapshot()</code>. There are some quirks to it, so I recommend perusing the
docs.</p>
<h2>The Goal: Use Both virtualenvs and renvs in Jupyter</h2>
<p>I'm a big fan of Jupyter Lab, and I use it for most of my downstream analysis
tasks in both R and Python. I use R more frequently despite liking Jupyter,
which I guess makes me kind of weird. I'm not using R Studio (which is a great
IDE for R too) because I want to use the same editor for notebooks in both
languages. There are ways to use reproducible environments for both languages
in Jupyter notebooks, so I thought "Why not find a configuration that allows the
use of reproducible R and Python environments in the <strong>same project</strong>."</p>
<p>This required a bit of tweaking, but I'm fairly happy with the result. To do
this you need to be a bit adventurous, but I promise it's not that hard.</p>
<h2>Global Configuration</h2>
<p>This has worked well for me in Ubuntu 22.04 (bare metal as well as WSL2) and
Manjaro Linux.</p>
<ol>
<li>Install <a href="https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv">pyenv</a>.<ul>
<li>Don't use your system python, especially on Linux, lots of the system can depend on it.</li>
<li>Using the system python makes managing packages a nightmare.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Install <a href="https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv">pyenv-virtualenv</a>.</li>
<li>Install the version of python you wish to use and set it as your global version.<ul>
<li>Make sure to use <code>--PYTHON_CONFIGURE_OPTS="--enable-shared</code> at a minimum.</li>
<li>The full command with pyenv that I use at the time of writing this is (you can use another
version if you wish):
<code>env PYTHON_CONFIGURE_OPTS="--enable-shared --enable-optimizations --with-lto" PYTHON_CFLAGS='-march=native -mtune=native' pyenv install 3.12.3</code></li>
<li><code>pyenv global 3.12.3</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Install jupyterlab and any other Python packages you want.<ul>
<li><code>pip install jupyterlab</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Install R using <a href="https://github.com/r-lib/rig">rig</a><ul>
<li>rig is optional but I really like it.</li>
<li>Installing R from the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/">CRAN</a> repository is also perfectly reasonable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Install the R kernel for Jupyter.<ul>
<li>Follow the instructions in the <a href="https://irkernel.github.io/">R Kernel</a> docs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>That gets you all the basics.</p>
<p>We are installing jupyter for the Global Python version. However, this global
Python is not the system Python and is not used directly for any data science
work, it's only for running jupyterlab.</p>
<h2>Create Your Project Folder</h2>
<p>I like to encapsulate each of my projects into a separate directory. This way,
a series of computational notebooks that share a common theme can be tracked
together with version control. Plus, a single environment can be used across notebooks
used for a single project. This makes it easy to know which project notebooks
belong to.</p>
<p>In this example I'm using <code>polyglot_jupyter_example</code> as the project name:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>mkdir<span class="w"> </span>polyglot_jupyter_example
<span class="nb">cd</span><span class="w"> </span>polyglot_jupyter_example
</code></pre></div>

<p>I then start jupyterlab in the project folder, or if you have a larger
structure that encompasses many projects, in that higher-level directory:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>jupyter<span class="w"> </span>lab
</code></pre></div>

<h2>Set-up the Python virtualenv</h2>
<ol>
<li>Make sure you're in the project/github repo directory.</li>
<li>Set a version of python in the current project folder.<ul>
<li><code>pyenv local 3.12.3</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Create a virtualenv, I just name them the same as the project.<ul>
<li><code>pyenv virtualenv polyglot_jupyter_example</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Activate the virtualenv. You don't have to stay in the directory you made, but it keeps things simple.<ul>
<li><code>pyenv activate polyglot_jupyter_example</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Install a minimal subset of packages needed for this example.<ul>
<li><code>pip install ipykernel pandas seaborn</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Add the ipykernel you installed in the virtualenv to your jupyter that's <strong>outside</strong> the virtualenv.<ul>
<li><code>python -m ipykernel install --user --name=polyglot_jupyter_example</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Exit the virtualenv<ul>
<li><code>pyenv deactivate</code></li>
<li>Don't worry, jupyter will still know about it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Start jupyter and you'll see that you can now create notebooks inside the virtualenv.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong> If you're used to installing pip packages, etc. within a
notebook by <code>! pip install {package}</code> you'll need to adjust your workflow. The
shell that jupyter spawns does not know about your virtualenv. Just keep a terminal
open outside the notebook.</p>
<p><img alt="Great Success!" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groverj3/polyglot_jupyter_example/main/images/python_env_jupyter.png"></p>
<h2>Set-up the Renv</h2>
<p>This is somewhat easier, because R isn't controlling jupyter.</p>
<ol>
<li>Inside the project directory, start R.<ul>
<li><code>R</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Install <code>renv</code>.<ul>
<li><code>install.packages("renv")</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Restart the R session.</li>
<li>Initialize an renv.<ul>
<li><code>renv::init(bare = TRUE)</code></li>
<li><code>bare = TRUE</code> keeps renv from parsing all text files in the project, if you're starting a
   project and it's not a blank slate (you have large notebooks and other files in it) this can cause renv to hang.</li>
<li>This creates a project-specific library, a <code>.Rprofile</code>, and <code>renv.lock</code> amongst other things.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Exit R, and add configure bioconductor if you use it<ul>
<li>Setup information for the posit package manager mirror of bioconductor: <a href="https://packagemanager.posit.co/client/#/repos/bioconductor/setup">here</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Enter R again and install the ir kernel and data science stack.<ul>
<li><code>install.packages(c("tidyverse", "IRkernel"))</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Make sure the R kernel is installed in jupyter outside the renv as well (as per the directions earlier).</li>
</ol>
<p>As long as you start your jupyter notebooks in the top level of the project folder then R kernels
will respect your Renv.</p>
<h2>Project Structure</h2>

<p>There is quite a bit going on here so I will elaborate:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>.python-version</code>: Records the local version of python in the project.</li>
<li><code>.gitignore</code>: Records any files that should be ignored by git.</li>
<li><code>.renvignore</code>: Records any files that should not be parsed by <code>renv</code>.</li>
<li><code>.Rprofile</code>: Project-specific configuration for R.</li>
<li><code>renv.lock</code>: Where <code>renv</code> records the packages in the environment (including
  versions). Similar in concept to a Python requirements.txt.</li>
<li><code>requirements.txt</code>: List of Python packages installed in the environment.</li>
<li><code>{python_notebook_names}_py.ipynb</code>: Jupyter notebooks that use Python get named
  with "_py.ipynb" to make it clear they use Python.</li>
<li><code>{python_notebook_outdirs}_py</code>: Output folders for Python notebooks, each
  Python notebook gets an output folder named the same as the parent notebook.<ul>
<li>Outputs from analysis go in here.</li>
<li>I also like to include the notebook is plain text .py format so they can
  be run without Jupyter, and in .html format so they can be viewed by
  non-coders.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>{r_notebook_names}_r.ipynb</code>: Jupyter notebooks that use R get named with "_r.ipynb".<ul>
<li><code>{r_notebook_outdirs}_r</code>: The same schme as <code>{python_notebook_outdirs}</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>README.md: Summary of the project.</li>
</ul>
<p>The companion github repository is <a href="https://github.com/groverj3/polyglot_jupyter_example">here</a>
and has examples of all these files, as well as two example notebooks. I
recommend checking them out.</p>
<h2>Notes on .gitignore and .renvignore</h2>
<p>By default renv will parse all files in your project to determine which
packages need to be tracked in the <code>renv.lock</code>. This can be problematic if you
have large files, including notebooks in the project folder.</p>
<p>One way around this is to add large files to <code>.gitignore</code>. Renv respects that as a list
of files and subdirectories not to parse. You'll notice this already will exist
in the <code>./renv/</code> subdirectory it creates your project-specific library in, to
avoid having git track all that. This probably isn't sufficient to avoid having
issues with it parsing notebooks, which you likely <em>do</em> want to track with git.</p>
<p>If you create an <code>.renvignore</code> in your project folder then Renv will use that
<em>instead</em> of <code>.gitignore</code>. I have been naming notebooks I write python in with
<code>_py</code> on the end so I can match them and output folders in <code>.renvignore</code>
easily. This is kind of clunky though.</p>
<p>In light of this, I set up my <code>.gitignore</code> with typical settings from jupyter
notebooks like this: <a href="https://github.com/groverj3/polyglot_jupyter_example/blob/main/.gitignore">.gitignore</a>.
Ignoring the <code>.ipynb_checkpoints</code> and <code>.virtual_documents</code> folders.</p>
<p>For <code>.renvignore</code>, I create one that ignores all python-based notebooks. You may
want to tweak this to your liking: <a href="https://github.com/groverj3/polyglot_jupyter_example/blob/main/.renvignore">.renvignore</a>.
You can get around the behavior of renv trying to parse large files by forcing
it to record <strong>all</strong> packages <em>installed</em> in an environment rather than just
ones <em>used</em> and their dependencies. This is demonstrated in the
<a href="https://github.com/groverj3/polyglot_jupyter_example/blob/main/polyglot_jupyter_example_r.ipynb">R notebook example</a>
with <code>renv::snapshot(type = "all")</code>.</p>
<h2>Restoring an Environment</h2>
<p>If you need to restore the environment at a later date, or on a new machine,
you will need to enter the project folder; then set up a new virtualenv for
Pythonm install the packages from the <code>requirements.txt</code>, and install the
ipython kernel to your jupyter as you did during the initial set-up:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>pyenv<span class="w"> </span>virtualenv<span class="w"> </span><span class="o">{</span>polyglot_project_name<span class="o">}</span><span class="w">  </span><span class="c1"># This should already use the local python version from .python-version</span>
pyenv<span class="w"> </span>activate<span class="w"> </span><span class="o">{</span>polyglot_project_name<span class="o">}</span>
pip<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>-r<span class="w"> </span>requirements.txt
python<span class="w"> </span>-m<span class="w"> </span>ipykernel<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>--user<span class="w"> </span>--name<span class="o">={</span>polyglot_project_name<span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>You'll then need to make sure you have R and renv installed before opening an
R terminal and running:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">renv</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="nf">restore</span><span class="p">()</span>
</code></pre></div>

<h2>Notes on Alternative Setups</h2>
<p>There is more than one way to do this. <a href="https://python-poetry.org/">Poetry</a> is
one attractive option, but I decided against this as it's another dependency and
this was already plenty complicated. I intended this as a minimal example of
such a setup depending only on Python, R, virtualenvs (python, through pyenv),
and renv(R). Some will prefer to opt for <a href="https://conda.io">conda</a> environments
instead, since there is some support for R. Anaconda is pretty heavy and I'm
not a fan, but miniconda is certainly an option. <a href="https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba">Mamba</a>
is a great option to manage conda environments which is much faster.</p>
<p>Then, there's the nuclear option of every environment being a standalone
<a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> or <a href="https://podman.io/">Podman</a> container.
This is attractive when you don't need to interact much with a host system, and
therefore is a good fit for working in "the cloud." Of course, there are ways
around that by mounting local storage inside your containers. You still need to document
your environments to be able to recreate them.</p>
<p>Perhaps you vastly prefer R over Python, and would rather call Python from R
using <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/">reticulate</a>. Reticulate actually
works with this set-up as well, you do need to force it to use the virtual
environment you created for your project with <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/reference/use_python.html"><code>use_python()</code></a>.</p>
<p>If you have a strong preference for Python, then you might already use
<a href="https://rpy2.github.io/">rpy2</a>. This is similar in concept to reticulate, but
I can't speak to how well it works with a setup like this, or if it would even
be necessary. This does require you to call R from Python, rather than writing
standalone R notebooks though.</p>
<p>There are probably improvements I'll add over time if I get around to it.
However, this may give you some ideas of your own when it comes to living the
polyglot data science/bioinformatics life.</p>
